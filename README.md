Main goal – to create a simple and easy to navigate console program, which can help Santa to manage his gifts for children during Christmas.

Extra program file, named “test.wav” will let user listen to „Mariah Carey - All I want for Christmas is you“ while user will be using written program. 
This file should play automatically and user can stop it whenever he wants by choosing specific function in Menu.

Possible actions when the program is in use:
•	Print all data about not paired children and gifts. 
•	Check how many children have gifts and print all relevant information.
•	Add additional children or gifts to the list. 
•	Pair child with a gift randomly.
•	Manually assign gift to child. 
•	Assign all the gifts to available children at once.

Additional actions are available to stop music and exit the program at any time.
